If you have run the aztec node through the CLI, then this will surely be useful to you.

Since the container may stop due to a critical error, you can use a simple restart in case of a shutdown.

create file ```nano ~/yourfilename.sh```

we copy and paste this in there, having previously entered our data, after that, we save the file Ctrl+X , press Y , press Enter

make an executable file ```chmod +x ~/yourfilename.sh```

launching the file in screen ```screen -S aztec``` 

exiting the session without stopping the process Ctrl+A +D
